# School Management System - A Comprehensive Educational Institution Management Platform

This project is a full-stack web application designed to streamline school administration by providing a centralized platform for managing students, teachers, classes, subjects, attendance, and communications. The system offers role-based access with separate dashboards for administrators, teachers, and students, enabling efficient management of educational operations.

The application features a React-based frontend with Material-UI components for a modern, responsive interface, and a Node.js/Express backend with MongoDB for robust data management. Key features include student and teacher management, attendance tracking, exam results recording, notice board functionality, and a complaint management system. The platform emphasizes security through role-based authentication and provides real-time updates for attendance and academic performance monitoring.

## Usage Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd school-management-system
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

4. Configure environment variables:
Create `.env` files in both backend and frontend directories with necessary configurations.

### Quick Start
1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### More Detailed Examples

1. Admin Dashboard Usage:
```javascript
// Access admin dashboard
// Login with admin credentials
const adminLogin = {
  email: "admin@school.com",
  password: "password"
};

// Manage classes
// Add a new class
const newClass = {
  className: "Class 10A",
  subjects: ["Mathematics", "Science", "English"]
};
```

2. Teacher Dashboard Usage:
```javascript
// Mark student attendance
const attendance = {
  studentId: "123",
  subject: "Mathematics",
  status: "Present",
  date: "2023-12-01"
};
```

### Troubleshooting

1. Database Connection Issues
- Error: "MongoDB connection failed"
  - Check if MongoDB service is running
  - Verify database connection string in `.env`
  - Ensure network connectivity

2. Authentication Issues
- Error: "Invalid credentials"
  - Clear browser cache and cookies
  - Check if the correct API endpoint is being used
  - Verify user credentials in the database

## Data Flow
The application follows a structured data flow pattern for managing educational institution data.

```ascii
[Client Browser] <--> [React Frontend] <--> [Express Backend] <--> [MongoDB Database]
     |                      |                      |                     |
     |                      |                      |                     |
User Interface    State Management(Redux)    API Controllers       Data Storage
```

Key Component Interactions:
1. Frontend components make API calls to backend endpoints
2. Backend controllers handle business logic and database operations
3. MongoDB schemas enforce data structure and relationships
4. Redux manages client-side state and API communication
5. Role-based authentication controls access to different features
6. Real-time updates for attendance and notices
7. Secure data transmission using JWT tokens
